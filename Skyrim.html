<p style="color:white;">The Dragonbone came from the Imperial lands of Cyrodiil. After being caught by the Imperial government for alleged plotting against the government, he was sentenced to death in the land of Skyrim.  While  next in line to be executed, a dragon came out of no where and attacked the execution.  At that time he began to have a tingling sensation an dshot fire out from his arms.  That is when he knew he had dragon blood.
